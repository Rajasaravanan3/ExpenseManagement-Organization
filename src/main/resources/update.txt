check for isActive in all getMapping endpoints

only admin can add budget, category

add getAllCategories (active categories alone)
check if getCategoryById endpoint is needed if not, change return type of getCategoryById to Category in service to ease setter's

add admin can delete(or set isActive column) currency, paymentmethod, role and only admin can update and add currency, paymentmethod, role
add cascade to delete currency, paymentmethod, expense, role

clarify whether admin can be set by organization only

verify all endpoints
